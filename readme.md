# ToDo.ly

#### We're going to build a simple ToDo app. Most of the items are in place, but we need to make it sleek and cool and AJAXy.
- On the home page, there is a form for creating new To Dos, and a list of all existing To Dos
- Make it so that when users submit the "To Do" form, the form submit asynchronously to create a new To Do
- Once a new To Do is created, add it to the list of existing To Dos
- If the user clicks the checkbox next to a To Do, it should update the To Do both visually (mark it "done"), as well as update it in the database
- If the user clicks the "X" next to a To Do, it should remove the item from the list, and delete it in the database

__BONUS__: Add a way for users to edit their To Dos "inline" by double clicking on the To Do text to show an edit form
